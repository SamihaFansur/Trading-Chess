# Trading Chess

Trading Chess is an innovative chess variant that seamlessly combines real-time stock data with traditional chess gameplay. In this unique twist on the classic game, each chess piece is associated with a specific stock, and its capturing abilities are determined by the stock's current value. This project's primary goal is to provide users with an engaging and familiar platform to learn about finance and investment strategies.

## Features

- **Real-time Stock Integration**: Every chess piece is connected to a real stock, and their gameplay impact fluctuates dynamically with the stock's value.
- **Stock Value Dependency**: A chess piece can only capture another piece if its associated stock's value is higher.
- **Responsive Design**: The user interface gracefully adapts to various screen sizes, ensuring a consistent gaming experience across all devices.
- **Custom Styled Components**: The UI is crafted using styled-components, offering a modern and sleek appearance.
- **Tutorial Mode**: A comprehensive guide is available to teach users how to play, combining chess strategies with financial insights.
- **Multi-platform Support**: Supports local, bot, and online gameplay modes.
